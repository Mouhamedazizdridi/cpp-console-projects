# C++ Console Projects

This folder contains my C++ console projects developed while following the **Algorithms and Problem Solving** course series by **Abu Hadhud**. Each project corresponds to a specific topic or lesson in the course and is written for learning and practice purposes.

## Projects

### 🏦 bank1.cpp
This is a simple **Bank Management System** built as part of **Course 7** in the Abu Hadhud algorithm series.

Features:
- Add, show, update, delete, find clients
- Display client list
- Simulated console menu system

> Developed using core C++ concepts like structs, vectors, switch-case, files, enums, and input/output formatting.

---
### 🏦 bank-extension.cpp
This project is an **enhanced version** of `bank1.cpp`, adding a new interactive **Transactions Menu** (option 6 in the main menu).

🧾 **New features:**
- Transactions Menu:
  - Deposit
  - Withdraw
  - Show Total Balance
  - Return to Main Menu (option 4)
- Nested menus with clean user navigation
- Fixed logic to prevent double pause messages (clean return to main menu)

This project builds on the core logic from `bank1.cpp`, while improving user interaction and scalability.


More projects will be added soon as I continue learning through the course!
