# C++ Console Projects

This folder contains my C++ console projects developed while following the **Algorithms and Problem Solving** course series by **Abu Hadhud**. Each project corresponds to a specific topic or lesson in the course and is written for learning and practice purposes.

## Projects

### 🏦 bank1.cpp
This is a simple **Bank Management System** built as part of **Course 7** in the Abu Hadhud algorithm series.

Features:
- Add, show, update, delete, find clients
- Display client list
- Simulated console menu system

> Developed using core C++ concepts like structs, vectors, switch-case, files, enums, and input/output formatting.

More projects will be added soon as I continue learning through the course!
